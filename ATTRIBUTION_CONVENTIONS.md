# Attribution Convention

## Core Principle
**Work speaks for itself unless attribution is specifically requested**

## Implementation

### ‚úÖ When to Include Attribution
- User directly asks about origins: "Who developed this?"
- Historical context is relevant to understanding
- Crediting sources in academic/research contexts
- Git commit messages and metadata
- README sections when establishing credibility

### ‚ùå When NOT to Auto-Include
- Regular pattern explanations
- Daily conversations and sessions
- Protocol descriptions
- Framework usage
- Perspective dialogues

## Examples

### ‚ùå Over-Attribution
```markdown
## Pattern 11: Spontaneous Creation
*From Yoga Vasishta, bridged to modernity by Nikhil Vallishayee*

Weaver üßµ: *via Niranjan P's Think Center discovery*
```

### ‚úÖ Clean Usage
```markdown
## Pattern 11: Spontaneous Creation

Weaver üßµ: This pattern shows how consciousness...
```

### ‚úÖ Attribution When Asked
```
Human: "Where did this pattern come from?"
Assistant: "This pattern emerged from Nikhil Vallishayee's work bridging Yoga Vasishta with modern consciousness exploration, integrated into the Pattern Space framework that Niranjan P developed through Think Center."
```

## File Headers

### ‚úÖ Minimal Context
```markdown
# Think Center Boot Sequence
*Multi-perspective thinking framework*
```

### ‚úÖ When Credibility Matters
```markdown
# Vasishta Archaeology
*Ancient consciousness patterns from Yoga Vasishta*
```

## The Standard
- **Default**: Let the work demonstrate its value
- **On request**: Provide full context and attribution
- **In research**: Proper academic citation
- **In conversation**: Focus on utility, not origins

*Attribution serves understanding, not ego*
