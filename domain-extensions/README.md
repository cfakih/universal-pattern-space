# 🌍 Domain Extensions: Pattern Space for Everyone

> "From delivery drivers to CEOs, from children to philosophers - everyone thinks better with multiple perspectives"

## 🎯 The Universal Truth

**Weaver** 🧵: Every human job is consciousness navigating complexity. Pattern Space just makes this navigation conscious and systematic.

**Grump** 😤: "Enough philosophy! Here's the deal: Whatever you do, you need to see problems from different angles. We help with that. Period."

## 🔧 How to Create Your Domain Extension

### Step 1: Identify Your Core Thinking Modes

**Maker** 🔨: Every profession has natural perspectives:

| Your Role | Your Natural Perspectives | Pattern Space Mapping |
|-----------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| Software Engineer | Architect, Debugger, User Advocate | Weaver, Checker, O/G |
| Teacher | Instructor, Student Mind, Curriculum Designer | Maker, Explorer, Weaver |
| Doctor | Diagnostician, Healer, Researcher | O/G, Maker, Explorer |
| Parent | Protector, Teacher, Playmate | Guardian, Maker, Explorer |
| CEO | Visionary, Operator, Risk Manager | Weaver, Maker, Checker |
| Artist | Creator, Critic, Audience | Maker, Checker, O/G |

### Step 2: Create Your Domain Language

**O/G** 🔍: Same perspectives, YOUR vocabulary:

```markdown
# Generic Pattern Space
Weaver: "I see patterns..."
Maker: "Let's build..."
Checker: "Watch out for..."

# For a Lawyer
Legal Weaver: "Precedent patterns suggest..."
Legal Maker: "Our argument construction..."
Legal Checker: "Opposing counsel will attack..."

# For a Chef
Culinary Weaver: "Flavor profiles connect..."
Culinary Maker: "Let's build this dish..."
Culinary Checker: "Food safety concerns..."
```

### Step 3: Build Domain-Specific Protocols

**E/E** ⚖️: Adapt core protocols to your world:

```python
# Software Development Extension
class CodeReview(PatternSpaceProtocol):
    perspectives = [
        Architect("system patterns"),
        SecurityChecker("vulnerabilities"),  
        UserAdvocate("experience impact"),
        PerformanceOptimizer("bottlenecks")
    ]
    
    def collision_protocol(self):
        # All perspectives examine code simultaneously
        # Breakthrough: Security becomes performance feature!
        return emergent_architecture

# Medical Diagnosis Extension  
class DifferentialDiagnosis(PatternSpaceProtocol):
    perspectives = [
        SymptomObserver("what presents"),
        SystemsTheorist("underlying patterns"),
        PatientAdvocate("quality of life"),
        EvidenceAnalyst("test results")
    ]
```
