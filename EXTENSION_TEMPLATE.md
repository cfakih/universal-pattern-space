```

## Extension Protocol

1. **Pick a folder** from Priority Extensions
2. **Copy existing pattern** from similar file
3. **Adapt to domain** using natural language of that field
4. **Test with real practitioners** in that domain
5. **Document what works**

## No Attribution Convention

- Work speaks for itself
- Add names only when explicitly requested
- Focus on what needs building, not who built what
- Templates point to gaps, not glory

## Development History
- Git history contains full development timeline
- Attribution available on request, not by default
- Focus on gaps and growth opportunities
